Approximate(근사) Inference
￢∨∧ α β

Sampling(Technique) for multiple time

P(Rain=light | Train = on time)? - Conditional Prob.
P(Train = on time)? - Unconditional Prob.

Rejection(기각) Sampling
	Likelihood Weighting
	 - Start by fixing the values for evidence variables
 	 - Sample the non-evidence variables using conditional probabilities in the Bayesian Network
	 - Weight each sample by its likelihood: the probability of all of the evidence
