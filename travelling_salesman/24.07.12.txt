Probability(확률)

Possible Worlds
P(ω) == probability of omega
0 ≤ P(ω) ≤ 1

   ∑   P(ω) = 1
ω∈Ω

P(SUM to 12) = 1/36
P(SUM to 7) = 6/36 = 1/6

unconditional(비조건부) probability
degree of belief in a proposition(제의) in the absence(없음) of any other evidence(증거)

conditional(조건부) probability
degree of belief in a proposition given some exvidence that has already been revealed(보이는)
P (a | b) -> a given b

P(a | b) = P(a ∧ b) / P(b)
P(a ∧ b) = P(b)P(a | b) = P(a)P(b | a)

random variable
a variable in probability theory(이론) with a domain of possible values it can take on

probability distribution
P(Flight = on time) = 0.6
P(Flight = in delayed) = 0.3
P(Flight = in cancelled) = 0.1
P(flight) = <0.6, 0.3, 0.1>

independence(독립)
the knowledge that one event occurs(발생하다) does not affect the probability of the other event
P(a ∧ b) = P(a)P(b | a)
P(a ∧ b) = P(a)P(b)

Bayes' Rule
P(b | a) = P(b)P(a | b)/P(a)
