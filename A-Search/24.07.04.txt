uninformed search - search strategy that uses no problem-specific knowledge

informed search - search strategy that uses problem-specific knowledge to find solutions more efficiently

greedy best-first search - search algorithm that expands the node that is closest to the goal, as estimated by a heuristic function
heuristic function => manhattan distance   A = (x1, y1) B = (x2, y2)   ---> | x1 - x2 | + | y1 - y2 |

A* search - search algorithm that expands node with lowest value of g(n) + h(n)
g(n) = cost to reach node
h(n) = estimated cost to goal
optimal of 
- h(n) is admissible (never overestimates the true cost), and
- h(n) is consistent (for every node n and successor n' with step cost c, h(n) â‰¤ h(n') + c)
