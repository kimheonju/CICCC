inference rules

modus ponens
and elimination
double negation elimination

P -> Q == ￢P ∨ Q
P -> Q !== Q -> P
α <-> β == (α -> β) ∧ (β -> α)
￢(α ∧ β) == ￢α ∨ ￢β
￢(α ∨ β) == ￢α ∧ ￢β 
(α ∧ (β ∨ γ)) == (α ∧ β) ∨ (α ∧ γ)
(α ∨ (β ∧ γ)) == (α ∨ β) ∧ (α ∨ γ)

theorem proving

	initial state: starting knowledge base
	actions: inference rules
	transition model: nwe knowledge base after inference
	goal test: check statement we're trying to prove
	path cost finction: number of steps in proof


Resolution
opposite things are cancel each other

clause
a disjunction(= OR) of literals(symbols or not symbols) / a bunch of literals 
e.g. P ∨ Q ∨ R

conjunctive normal form(CNF)
logical sentence that is a conjunction(= AND) of clauses
e.g. (A ∨ B ∨ C) ∧ (D ∨ ￢E) ∧ (F ∨ G)

Conversion to CNF
- Eliminate biconditionals
   - turn (α <-> β) into (α -> β) ∧ (β -> α)
- Eliminate implications
   - turn α -> β == ￢α ∨ β
- Move ￢ inwards using De Morgan's Laws
   - e.g. turn ￢(α ∧ β) == ￢α ∨ ￢β
- Use distribute law to Distribute ∨ wherever possible
   - to put ∨ inside and ∧ outside
