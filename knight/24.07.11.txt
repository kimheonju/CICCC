Inference(추론) by Resolution(결심)
￢∨∧ α β
P ∨ Q ∨ S + ￢P ∨ R ∨ S == (Q ∨ R ∨ S)

P + ￢P == ( ) Empty -> False

to determine(결정하다) if KB |= α :
	check if (KB ∧ ￢α) is a contradiction(모순)?
	if so, then KB |= α .
	otherwise, no entailment(한정)

to determine if KB |= α :
	convert(KB ∧ ￢α) to Conjunctive Normal Form
	Keep checking to see if we can use resolution to produce(생산) a new clause(조항)
		if ever we produce the empty clause (equivalent(동등한) to False), we have a contradiction, and KB |= α
		Otherwise, if we can't add new clauses, no entailment

Dose (A ∨ B) ∧ (￢B ∨ C) ∧ (￢C) entail A?
	(A ∨ B) ∧ (￢B ∨ C) ∧ (￢C) ∧ (￢A)
	(A ∨ B) ∧ (￢B ∨ C) ∧ (￢C) ∧ (￢A) = resolve(해결 each other) ==> (A) ∧ (￢A) == ( ) Empty -> False

Universal Quantification
∀x. BelongsTo(x, Gryffindor) -> BelongsTo(x, Hufflepuff)
== for all objects x, if x belongs to gryffindor, then x does not belong to hufflepuff.

￢∨∧
Existential Quantification
∃x. House(x) ∧ BelongsTo(Minerva, x)
== there exists an object x such that x is a house and Minerva belongs to x.
Minerva Belongs to a house

∀x. Person(x) -> ∃y. House(y) and BelongsTo(x,y))
== For all objects x, if x is a person, then there exists an object y such that y is a house and x belongs to y.
Every person belongs to house
