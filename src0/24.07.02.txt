search problems

	initial state

	actions - choices that can be made in a state
	actions returns the set of actions that can be executed in state

	transition model - a description of what state results from performing any applicable action in any state
	result returns the state resulting from performing action in state

	state space - the set of all states reachable from the initial state by any sequence of actions

	goal test - way to determine whether a given state is a goal state

	path cost - numerical cost associated with a given path

solution - a sequence of actions that leads from the initial state to a goal state

optimal solution - a solution that has the lowest path cost among all solutions

node 
a data structure that keep track of 
	- a state
	- a parent (node that generated this node)
	- an action (action applied to parent to get node)
	- a path cost (from initial state to node)

Approach
- start with a frontier that contains the initial state
- repeat:
	- if the frontier is empty, then no solution..
	- remove a node from the frontier.
	- if node contains goal state, return the solution.
	- expand node, add resulting nodes to the frontier.

Revised Approach
- start with a frontier that contains the initial state
- start with an empty explored set
- repeat:
	- if the frontier is empty, then no solution..
	- remove a node from the frontier.
	- if node contains goal state, return the solution.
	- add the node to the explored set
	- expand node, add resulting nodes to the frontier if they aren't already in the frontier or the explored set
